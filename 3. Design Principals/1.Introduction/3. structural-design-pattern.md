# Structural Design Patterns

## Introduction
These patterns are concerned with object relationships and the structure of classes or objects. They help to add new functionality without having to modify the entire system. They ensure that if one part of a system changes, the whole system does not change with it.

## Decorator pattern

## Facade pattern
Provides a simpler interface that hides the complex functionalities of a system. The Facade pattern allows us to hide all the messy logic from the client and only display the clear and easy-to-use interface to them.

## Adapter pattern
Allows classes that have different interfaces (properties/methods of an object) to work together. It translates the interface for a class to make it compatible with another class. This pattern is useful if an API is modified or new implementations are added to it. In this case, if the other parts of a system are still using the old API, the Adapter pattern will translate the interface so that the two can work together.

## Bridge pattern
Allows separate components with separate interfaces to work together. It keeps an objectâ€™s interface separate from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.

## Composite pattern
The Composite pattern is used to structure objects in a tree-like hierarchy. 

## Flyweight pattern
Focuses on how related objects share data

## Proxy pattern
creates a proxy object. It acts as a placeholder for another object, controlling access to it.
