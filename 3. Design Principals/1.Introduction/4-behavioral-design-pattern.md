# Behavioral Design Patterns


## Introduction
Ensure effective communication between different objects in a system, assign responsibilities to them, and make sure they all have synchronized information.

## Chain of Responsibility pattern
Allows a request sent by a client to be received by more than one object. It creates a chain of loosely-coupled objects that, upon receiving the request, either handle it or pass it to the next handler object.

- It can be used where a program is written to handle various requests in different ways without knowing the sequence and type of requests beforehand. 

## Command pattern
Allows encapsulation of the requests or operations into separate objects. It decouples the objects that send requests from the objects responsible for executing those requests.

## Iterator pattern
Allows the definition of various types of iterators that can be used to sequentially iterate a collection of objects without exposing the underlying form.

## Mediator pattern
It is a behavioral pattern that allows a mediator (a central authority) to act as the coordinator between different objects instead of the objects referring to each other directly. A mediator, as the name implies, is a central authority through which various components can communicate. It allows the loose coupling of objects.

## Observer pattern
It allows objects (observers) that have subscribed to an event to wait for input and react to it when notified. Therefore, they donâ€™t have to continuously keep checking whether the input has been provided or not. 

## Visitor pattern
Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
